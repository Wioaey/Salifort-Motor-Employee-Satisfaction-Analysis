# Salifort-Motor-Employee-Satisfaction-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
Employee satisfaction and retention are essential to maintaining a productive workforce. The HR department at Salifort Motors is committed to improving employee satisfaction but requires data-driven insights to make informed decisions. To support this initiative, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify key factors influencing employee attrition and develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of employees leaving the company.


## Business Problem
The HR department seeks to answer a critical question:
What factors contribute to employee turnover, and how can they be mitigated?

Employee attrition leads to significant costs related to hiring, training, and lost productivity. By identifying key drivers of turnover, Salifort Motors can implement strategic initiatives to enhance employee satisfaction and retention, ultimately improving overall organizational performance.

## Project Objectives
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of employee data to uncover trends and patterns related to attrition.
- Develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of employee turnover.
- Identify the primary factors influencing job satisfaction and employee retention.

## Data Sources
The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)
