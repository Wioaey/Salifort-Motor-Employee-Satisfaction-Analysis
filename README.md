# Salifort-Motor-Employee-Satisfaction-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
Employee satisfaction and retention are essential to maintaining a productive workforce. The HR department at Salifort Motors is committed to improving employee satisfaction but requires data-driven insights to make informed decisions. To support this initiative, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify key factors influencing employee attrition and develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of employees leaving the company.


## Business Problem
The HR department seeks to answer a critical question:
What factors contribute to employee turnover, and how can they be mitigated?

Employee attrition leads to significant costs related to hiring, training, and lost productivity. By identifying key drivers of turnover, Salifort Motors can implement strategic initiatives to enhance employee satisfaction and retention, ultimately improving overall organizational performance.

## Project Objectives
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of employee data to uncover trends and patterns related to attrition.
- Develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of employee turnover.
- Identify the primary factors influencing job satisfaction and employee retention.
- Provide strategic, data-driven recommendations to reduce turnover and enhance workplace engagement.

## Data Sources
The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)
The analysis leverages employee data, including:

- Demographic Information: Age, gender, department, and education level.

- Job-related Factors: Salary, job role, tenure, promotions, workload, and work-life balance.

- Performance Metrics: Performance ratings, project involvement, and training hours.

- Employee Feedback: Satisfaction scores, engagement levels, and workplace environment assessments.

## Analytical Approach
The following project follows a structured analytical framework:

1) **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
2) **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying key trends, correlations, and anomalies in employee satisfaction, tenure, compensation, and other relevant factors.
3) **Feature Selection**: Determining the most influential factors impacting  employee attrition.
4) **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict employee turnover.
5) **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score to measure overall effectiveness.
6) **Strategic Recommendations**: Developing actionable insights to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

## Tools and Technologies
The project utilizes a range of analytical tools and techniques, including:
- **Programming and Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and etc.)
- **Data Visualization**: Python.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
